# Credit Card default Prediction 
**Introduction**
> In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou,2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and cashâ€“card debts. The crisis caused the blow to consumer finance confidence and it is a big challenge for both banks and cardholders.

> This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments.

> The main objective is to build a predictive classification model, which could help in predicting the defaulters among the credit card users.
